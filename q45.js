// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function storeCarInfo(manufacturer, modelname, ...extraoptions) {
    const combinedOptions = Object.assign({}, ...extraoptions);
    const carinfo = {
        manufacturer,
        modelname,
        ...combinedOptions,
    };
    return carinfo;
}
let answer = storeCarInfo("Honda", "Civic", { color: "black" }, { features: "navigation" });
